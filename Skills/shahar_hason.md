```
אז היום הלכתי לסופר...

רגע, תכף אני מספר.

בקיצור, עומד בתור. אחרי 15 דקות (!!!) מגיע סוף סוף לקופה.

והקופאית אומרת לי:
"יש לך כרטיס מועדון?"

אני: "לא"

היא: "אז תעשה, זה חינם"

אני: "בסדר, למה לא"

היא: "אז תלך לדלפק שירות"

אני: "אבל... התור..."

היא: "כן, תעמוד שוב"

😳

וזה אחי, סיפור חיים שלי.

```

Translation:
```
So I went to the supermarket today...

Wait, I'll tell you now.

Anyway, standing in line. After 15 minutes (!!!) finally get to the register.

And the cashier says to me:
"Do you have a club card?"

Me: "No"

Her: "So make one, it's free"

Me: "Okay, why not"

Her: "So go to the service desk"

Me: "But... the line..."

Her: "Yes, you'll stand again"

😳

And that, my friend, is the story of my life.
